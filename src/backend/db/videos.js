      "As an investor every person want to generate multi bagger return. But majority of people end up losing money rather than creating wealth. Hence, in this video, I have discussed about the best way to invest for long term wealth creation. I have discussed about the strategy to make a balanced portfolio and invest across stocks and mutual fund. I have also discussed about the active vs passive funds and Index vs ETF. Within passive funds, I have explained the concept of regular index fund vs equal weight index fund and ETF. This would give a good clarity to investors who are looking to create wealth in long term. You don’t need 10x return to generate wealth. You just need 12%-15% CAGR for 10-15 years to create wealth. Indian economy is looking strong and their is bright growth prospect for the next 20-30 years. The biggest lesson for wealth creation is to invest systematically with patience. That’s where it is important make a fine balance across stocks and mutual funds and within mutual fund between active and passive funds.",
